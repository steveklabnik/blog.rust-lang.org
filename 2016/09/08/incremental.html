    <div class="post">
      <p>I remember when, during the 1.0 anniversary presentation at the
<a href="https://air.mozilla.org/bay-area-rust-meetup-may-2016/">Bay Area Meetup</a>, Aaron Turon talked about Dropbox so far having been
pretty happy with using Rust in production there. <em>The core
team has been in touch with them regularly</em>, he said, <em>asking them, you know,
what do you need? And their answer is always: faster compiles ...</em> To the
seasoned Rust user it is no surprise that this solicited a knowing chuckle from
the audience. Improving compile times has actually been a major development
focus after Rust reached 1.0 -- although, up to this point, much of the work
towards this goal has gone into laying <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/04/19/MIR.html">architectural foundations</a> within
the compiler and we are only slowly beginning to see actual results.</p>
<p>One of the projects that is building on these foundations, and that should
help <strong>improve compile times</strong> a lot for typical workflows,
is <strong>incremental compilation</strong>. Incremental compilation avoids redoing work
when you recompile a crate, which will ultimately lead to a much faster
edit-compile-debug cycle.</p>
<p>Today we are announcing an <strong>alpha version</strong> of incremental compilation, which
marks an important milestone in the development of the feature: For the first
time since implementation started towards the end of last year, all of the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1298-incremental-compilation.md">basic components</a> are in place, the bulk of the groundwork has
been done. You can give it a try in the nightly version of the compiler:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">rustc -Zincremental=&lt;path&gt; ./main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>This will start the compiler in <strong>incremental mode</strong>, using whatever <code>&lt;path&gt;</code>
you've provided as the incremental compilation cache directory. We are also
working on a <a href="#tool">cargo subcommand to make this smoother</a>, letting you just
write <code>cargo incremental build</code>. Once things are working reliably, of course,
incremental compilation will be available through the default
<code>cargo build</code> command.</p>
<p>With that being said, incremental compilation is <strong>not production-ready</strong> yet:
You might see crashes, you might see cases where there is no actual reduction
in compile times and, most importantly, we still have to write extensive
regression tests that make sure that incrementally compiled programs are
always correct — so don't use it anywhere yet where it really matters. Over
the next few weeks and months, however, our focus will be on making the
implementation rock-solid from a correctness point of view and you will see
continuous, gradual improvements in the feature's efficiency, up to a point
where it will be transformative to your development experience.</p>
<p>This blog post will go through why and when incremental compilation is useful
to begin with, how our implementation of it works, what its current development
status is, and finally what's planned for the future and how you can contribute,
should you be so inclined.</p>
<h1><a href="#why-incremental-compilation-in-the-first-place" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="why-incremental-compilation-in-the-first-place"></a>Why Incremental Compilation in the First Place?</h1>
<p>Much of a programmer's time is spent in an <strong>edit-compile-debug</strong> workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>you make a <strong>small change</strong> (often in a single module or even function),</li>
<li>you let the compiler <strong>translate the code into a binary</strong>, and finally</li>
<li>you <strong>run the program</strong> or a bunch of unit tests in order to see results of
the change.</li>
</ul>
<p>After that it's back to step one, making the next small change informed
by the knowledge gained in the previous iteration.
This essential feedback loop is at the core of our daily work. We want the time
being stalled while waiting for the compiler to produce an executable program
to be as short as possible — ideally
short enough as not to warrant a time-consuming and stress-inducing mental
context switch: You want to be able to keep working, stay in the zone. After
all, there is only so much <a href="https://xkcd.com/303/">regressive fun</a> to be had while <code>rustc</code>
bootstraps.</p>
<p>Incremental compilation is a way of <strong>exploiting</strong> the fact that little changes
between compiles during the regular programming workflow: Many, if not most,
of the changes done in between two compilation sessions only have local impact
on the machine code in the output binary, while the rest of the program,
same as at the source level, will end up exactly the same, bit for bit.
Incremental compilation aims at retaining as much of those unchanged
parts as possible while redoing only that amount of work that actually <em>must</em>
be redone.</p>
<h1><a href="#how-do-you-make-something-incremental" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="how-do-you-make-something-incremental"></a>How Do You Make Something &quot;Incremental&quot;?</h1>
<p>We have already heard that computing something incrementally means updating
only those parts of the computation's output that need to be adapted in
response to a given change in the computation's inputs.
One basic strategy we can employ to achieve this is to view one big computation
(like compiling a program) as a <strong>composite</strong> of many smaller, interrelated
computations that build up on each other. Each of those smaller computations
will yield an <strong>intermediate result</strong> that can be <strong>cached</strong> and hopefully
<strong>re-used</strong> in a later iteration, sparing us the need to re-compute that
particular intermediate result again.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a simple example from algebra to make things more
concrete. Let's see what it means to evaluate an expression of the form
<code>a+b×c</code> incrementally. This will involve evaluating the expression once
with one set of values for <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, and then evaluating it a second
time with a different value for <code>a</code>. For the first time around, <code>a</code> will be
<code>1</code>, <code>b</code> will be <code>2</code>, and <code>c</code> will be <code>3</code>:</p>
<!--
       a+b×c=7
       /    \
      /     b×c=6
     /     /   \
    a=1   b=2  c=3
-->
<p><img src="/images/2016-08-Incremental/algebra-initial.svg" alt="Initial Computation of a+b×c" /></p>
<p>Assume that we &quot;saved&quot; the intermediate results at each step, that is, we
remember somewhere that <code>b×c</code> is <code>6</code> and <code>a+b×c</code> is <code>7</code>. Now, in the second
round, we want to know what <code>a+b×c</code> is if we change the value of <code>a</code> to
<code>4</code>. When we recompute the value of the expression, however, we see that we
already know that <code>b×c = 6</code>, so we don't have to perform that computation
again, and can rather skip directly to <code>(a = 4) + (b×c = 6)</code>. We thus have computed
the value of our expression in just one step instead of two, sparing us an
entire, tedious multiplication.</p>
<!--
       a+b×c=10
       /    \
      /     b×c=6
     /     /   \
    a=4   b=2  c=3
-->
<p><img src="/images/2016-08-Incremental/algebra-update.svg" alt="Updating the Computation" /></p>
<p>Let's see how this scheme translates to the compiler.</p>
<h1><a href="#an-incremental-compiler" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="an-incremental-compiler"></a>An Incremental Compiler</h1>
<p>The way we chose to implement incrementality in the Rust compiler is
straightforward: An incremental compilation session follows exactly the same
steps in the same order as a batch compilation session. However, when control
flow reaches a point where it is about to compute some non-trivial intermediate
result, it will try to load that result from the incremental compilation cache
on disk instead. If there is a valid entry in the cache, the compiler can just
skip computing that particular piece of data. Let's take a look at a (simplified)
overview of the different compilation phases and the intermediate results they
produce:</p>
<!--
* Diagram: compilation phases and their intermediate results

-->
<p><img src="/images/2016-08-Incremental/compiler-phases.svg" alt="Compiler Phases and their By-Products" /></p>
<p>First the compiler will parse the source code into an abstract syntax tree
(AST). The AST then goes through the analysis phase which produces type
information and the <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/04/19/MIR.html">MIR</a> for each function. After that, if analysis
did not find any errors, the codegen phase will transform the MIR version of
the program into its machine code version, producing one object file per
source-level module. In the last step all the object files get linked together
into the final output binary which may be a library or an executable.</p>
<p>Comparing that with our algebra example from above, the pieces of AST correspond
to <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, that is, they are the <strong>inputs</strong> to our incremental
computation and they determine what needs to be updated as we make our way
through the compilation process. The pieces of type information and MIR and the
object files, on the other hand, are our <strong>intermediate results</strong>, that is, they
correspond to the incremental computation cache entries we stored for
<code>b×c</code> and <code>a+b×c</code>. Where a cache entry looks like <code>b×c = 6</code> in the
algebra example, it would look something like
<code>translate_to_obj_file(mir1, mir2, mir3) = &lt;bits of the obj-file&gt;</code> in the case
of the compiler.</p>
<p>So, this seems pretty simple so far: Instead of computing something a second
time, just load the value from the cache. Things get tricky though when we need
to <strong>find out if</strong> it's actually valid to <strong>use a value from the cache</strong> or if we
have to <strong>re-compute</strong> it because of some changed input.</p>
<h1><a href="#dependency-graphs" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="dependency-graphs"></a>Dependency Graphs</h1>
<p>There is a formal method that can be used to model a computation's intermediate
results and their individual &quot;up-to-dateness&quot; in a straightforward way:
<strong>dependency graphs</strong>. It looks like this: Each input and each <strong>intermediate
result</strong> is represented as a <strong>node</strong> in a directed graph. The <strong>edges</strong> in the
graph, on the other hand, represent which intermediate result or input can have
an <strong>influence</strong> on some other intermediate result.</p>
<!-- edited out
More formally, let `v` be
some intermediate result and `N(v)` be the dependency graph node representing
`v` in the graph. Further, let `xᵢ` be the intermediate results and inputs
that have to be **read** when computing `v` and let `N(xᵢ)`
be their representing nodes. Then the dependency graph will contain the edges
`N(v) → N(xᵢ)` for all `i`. In other words, each edge records a dependency
of one intermediate result on another.
 -->
<p>Let's go back to our algebra example to see what this looks like in
practice:</p>
<!--
       a+b×c
       /   \
      /    b×c
     /    /   \
    a    b     c
-->
<p><img src="/images/2016-08-Incremental/algebra-dep-graph.svg" alt="Dependency Graph of a+b×c" /></p>
<p>As you can see, we have nodes for the inputs <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, and nodes for
the intermediate results <code>b×c</code> and <code>a+b×c</code>. The edges should come as no
surprise: There is one edge from <code>b×c</code> to <code>b</code> and one to <code>c</code> because those are
the values we need to read when computing <code>b×c</code>. For <code>a+b×c</code> it's
exactly the same. Note, by the way, that the above graph is a tree just because
the computation it models has the form of a tree. In general, dependency graphs
are <strong>directed acyclic graphs</strong>, as would be the case if we would
add another intermediate result <code>b×c+c</code> to our computation:</p>
<!--
       a+b×c   b×c+c
       /   \  /  |
      /    b×c   |
     /    /   \ /
    a    b     c
-->
<p><img src="/images/2016-08-Incremental/algebra-dep-graph-dag.svg" alt="Example of a non-tree Dependency Graph" /></p>
<p>What makes this data structure really useful is that we can ask it questions
of the form &quot;if X has changed, is Y still up-to-date?&quot;. We just take the node
representing <code>Y</code> and collect all the inputs <code>Y</code> depends on by transitively
following all edges originating from <code>Y</code>. If any of those inputs has changed,
the value we have cached for <code>Y</code> cannot be relied on anymore.</p>
<h1><a href="#dependency-tracking-in-the-compiler" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="dependency-tracking-in-the-compiler"></a>Dependency Tracking in the Compiler</h1>
<p>When compiling in incremental mode, we always build the dependency graph of the
produced data: every time, some piece of data is written (like an object file),
we record which other pieces of data we are accessing while doing so.</p>
<p>The emphasis is on <strong>recording</strong> here. At any point in time the compiler keeps
track of which piece of data it is currently working on (it does so in the
background in thread-local memory). This is the currently <strong>active node</strong> of the
dependency graph. Conversely, the data that needs to be <strong>read</strong> to compute
the value of the active node is also tracked: it usually already resides in some
kind container (e.g. a hash table) that requires invoking a lookup method to
access a specific entry. We make good use of this fact by making these <strong>lookup
methods transparently create edges</strong> in the dependency graph: whenever an entry
is accessed, we know that it is being read and we know what it is being read
<em>for</em> (the currently active node). This gives us both ends of the dependency edge
and we can simply add it to the graph. At the end of the compilation sessions we
have all our data nicely linked up, mostly automatically:</p>
<!--
         AST        type info      object
                       MIR          code        binary

       A A A A     T T T M M M     O O O O
       A A A A     T T T M M M     O O O O        B

-->
<p><img src="/images/2016-08-Incremental/compiler-dep-graph.svg" alt="Dependency Graph of Compilation Data" /></p>
<p>This dependency graph is then stored in the incremental compilation cache
directory along with the cache entries it describes.</p>
<p>At the beginning of a subsequent compilation session, we detect which inputs
(=AST nodes) have changed by comparing them to the previous version. Given the
graph and the set of changed inputs, we can easily find all cache entries that
are not up-to-date anymore and just remove them from the cache:</p>
<!--
         AST        type info      object

<p><img src="/images/2016-08-Incremental/compiler-cache-purge.svg" alt="Using the Dependency Graph to Validate the Incremental Compilation Cache" /></p>
<p>Anything that has survived this cache validation phase can safely be re-used
during the current compilation session.</p>
<p>There are a few benefits to the <strong>automated dependency tracking</strong> approach we
are employing. Since it is built into the compiler's internal APIs, it will
stay up-to-date with changes to the compiler, and it is hard to accidentally
forget about. And if one still forgets using it correctly (e.g. by not declaring
the correct <em>active node</em> in some place) then the result is an overly
<strong>conservative, but still &quot;correct&quot;</strong> dependency graph: It will negatively
impact the re-use ratio but it will not lead to incorrectly re-using some
outdated piece of data.</p>
<p>Another aspect is that the system does not try to predict or compute what the
dependency graph is going to look like, it just keeps track. A large part of
our (yet to be written) <strong>regression tests</strong>, on the other hand, <em>will</em> give a
description of what the dependency graph for a given program ought to look like.
This makes sure that the actual graph and the reference graph are arrived at
via <strong>different methods</strong>, reducing the risk that both the compiler and the
test case agree on the same, yet wrong, value.</p>
<h1><a href="#faster-up-to-15-or-more" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="faster-up-to-15-or-more"></a>&quot;Faster! Up to 15% or More.&quot;<a href="https://xkcd.com/870/">*</a></h1>
<p>Let's take a look at some of the implications of what we've learned so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dependency graph reflects the actual dependencies between parts of the
source code and parts of the output binary.</li>
<li>If there is some input node that is reachable from many intermediate
results, e.g. a central data type that is used in almost every function,
then changing the definition of that data type will mean that everything
has to be compiled from scratch, there's no way around it.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the effectiveness of incremental compilation is very sensitive
to the structure of the program being compiled and the change being made.
Changing a single character in the source code might very well invalidate the
whole incremental compilation cache. Usually though, this kind of change is
a rare case and most of the time only a small portion of the program has to be
recompiled.</p>
<h1><a href="#the-current-status-of-the-implementation" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="the-current-status-of-the-implementation"></a>The Current Status of the Implementation</h1>
<p>For the first spike implementation of incremental compilation, what we call the
alpha version now, we chose to focus on caching object files. Why did we do
that? Let's take a look at the compilation phases again and especially at how
much time is spent in each one on average:</p>
<!--
         AST        type info      object
                       MIR          code        binary

       A A A A     T T T M M M     O O O O
       A A A A     T T T M M M     O O O O        B
       A A A A     T T T M M M     O O O O
    >===========>===============>===========>===========>
        parse       analysis       codegen     linking
                                   optimize

TIME:    5%            20%         **65%**       10%
-->
<p><img src="/images/2016-08-Incremental/compiler-phases-cost.svg" alt="Relative Cost of Compilation Phases" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the Rust compiler spends most of its time in the optimization
and codegen passes. Consequently, if this phase can be skipped at least for
part of a code base, this is where the biggest impact on compile times can be
achieved.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we can also give an <strong>upper bound</strong> on how much time this
initial version of incremental compilation can save: If the compiler spends X
seconds optimizing when compiling your crate, then incremental compilation will
reduce compile times at most by those X seconds.</p>
<p>Another area that has a large influence on the actual effectiveness of the
alpha version is <strong>dependency tracking granularity</strong>: It's up to us how fine-grained
we make our dependency graphs, and the current implementation makes it rather
coarse in places. For example, the dependency graph
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/36349">only knows a single node for all methods in an <code>impl</code></a>.
As a consequence, the compiler will consider <em>all</em>
methods of that <code>impl</code> as changed if just one of them is changed. This of course
will mean that more code will be re-compiled than is strictly necessary.</p>
<h1><a href="#performance-numbers" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="performance-numbers"></a>Performance Numbers</h1>
<p>Here are some numbers of how the current implementation fares in various
situations. First let's take a look at the best case scenario where a 100%
of a crate's object files can be re-used. This might occur when changing one
crate in a multi-crate project and downstream crates need to be rebuilt but
are not really affected.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2016-08-Incremental/perf-full-re-use.svg" alt="Normalized Incremental Compilation Build Times" /></p>
<p>As you can see, compiling a crate for the first time in incremental mode can be
slower than compiling it in non-incremental mode. This is because the dependency
tracking incurs some additional cost when activated. Note that compiling
incrementally can also be faster (as in the case of the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/regex">regex</a> crate). This is
because incremental compilation splits the code into smaller optimization units
than a regular compilation session, resulting in less time optimizing, but
also in less efficient runtime code.</p>
<p>The last column shows the amount of time a rebuild of the crate takes when
nothing has actually changed. For crates where the compiler spends a lot of
time optimizing, like <a href="https://github.com/serde-rs/syntex/tree/master/syntex_syntax">syntex-syntax</a> or <code>regex</code>, the gain can
be substantial: The incremental rebuild only takes about 22% of the time a
full rebuild would need for <code>syntex-syntax</code>, only 16% for <code>regex</code>, and less than
10% for the <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/futures-rs/blob/master/tests/all.rs">all.rs test case</a> of the <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/futures-rs">futures-rs</a> crate.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for a crate like the <code>futures-rs</code> library that results in
little machine code when being compiled, the current version of incremental
compilation makes little difference: It's only 3% faster than compiling from
scratch.</p>
<p>The next graph shows which impact various changes made to the <code>regex</code> crate
have on incremental rebuild times:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2016-08-Incremental/perf-changes.svg" alt="Build Times After Specific Changes" /></p>
<p>The numbers show that the effectiveness of incremental compilation indeed depends a
lot on the type of change applied to the code. For changes with very local
effect we can get close to optimal re-use (as in the case of <code>Error::cause()</code>,
or <code>dfa::write_vari32()</code>). If we change something that has an impact on many
places, like <code>Compiler::new()</code>, we might not see a noticeable reduction in
compile times. But again, be aware that these measurements are from the
current state of the implementation. They do not reflect the
full potential of the feature.</p>

<p>The alpha version represents a minimal end-to-end implementation of incremental
compilation for the Rust compiler, so there is lots of room for improvement. The
section on the current status already laid out the two major axes along which
we will pursue increased efficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cache more</strong> intermediate results, like MIR and type information, which will
allow the compiler to skip more and more steps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make <strong>dependency tracking more precise</strong>, so that the compiler encounters
fewer false positives during cache invalidation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Improvements in both of these directions will make incremental compilation
more effective as the implementation matures.</p>
<p>In terms of correctness, we tried to err on the side of caution from the get-go,
rather making the compiler recompute something if we were not sure if our
dependency tracking did the right thing, but there is still more that can be
done.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We want to have many <strong>more auto-tests</strong> that make sure that various basic components
of the system <strong>don't regress</strong>. This is an area where interested people can
start contributing with relative ease, since one only needs to understand the
Rust language and the test framework, but not the more complicated innards of
the compiler's implementation. If you are interested in jumping in, head on

<p><a name="tool"></a> We are working on the
<a href="https://github.com/nikomatsakis/cargo-incremental"><em>cargo incremental</em></a> tool (implemented as a Cargo
subcommand for hassle-free installation and usage) that will walk a projects
git history, compiling successive versions of the source code and
<strong>collecting data</strong> on the <strong>efficiency</strong> and <strong>correctness</strong> of
incremental versus regular compilation. If you're interested in helping out,
consider yourself invited to either hack on the tool itself or downloading
and running it on a project of yours. The <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/community.html">#rustc channel on IRC</a>
is currently the best place to get further information regarding this.</p>
