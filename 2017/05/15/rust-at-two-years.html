      <p>Rust is a language for confident, productive systems programming. It aims to
make systems programming accessible to a wider audience, and to raise the
ambitions of dyed-in-the-wool systems hackers.</p>
<p>It's been two years since Rust 1.0 was released. Happy second birthday, Rust!</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017-05-Second-Birthday/rustfest-berlin.jpeg" alt="Group picture from RustFest Berlin" /></p>
<p><em>Rustaceans at RustFest Berlin, September 2016. Picture by Fiona Casti√±eira</em></p>
<p>Over these two years, we have demonstrated stability without stagnation,
maintaining backwards compatibility with version 1.0 while also making many
improvements.  Conveniently, Rust's birthday is a bit under halfway through
2017, which makes this a great time to reflect not only on the progress in the
last year but also on the progress of our <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/02/06/roadmap.html">2017 Roadmap</a> goals.</p>
<p>After reading this post, if you'd like to give us your feedback on how we're
doing and where Rust should focus next, please fill out our <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/05/03/survey.html">2017 State of Rust
survey</a>.</p>
<p>But first, let's do the numbers!</p>
<h2><a href="#rust-in-numbers" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="rust-in-numbers"></a>Rust in numbers</h2>
<p>A lot has happened since <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/05/16/rust-at-one-year.html">Rust's first birthday</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>10,800 <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commits/master">commits</a> by 663 contributors (438 of them new this year) added to the core repository;</li>
<li>56 <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs">RFCs</a> merged;</li>
<li>9 minor releases and 2 patch releases shipped;</li>
<li>4,405 new <a href="https://crates.io/">crates</a> published;</li>
<li>284 standard library stabilizations;</li>
<li>10 languages <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">rust-lang.org</a> has been translated into;</li>
<li>48 new companies <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/friends.html">running Rust in production</a>;</li>
<li>4 new teams (Docs, Style, Infrastructure, and the Unsafe Guidelines strike team);</li>
<li>24 occasions of adding people to teams, 6 retirings of people from teams;</li>
<li>3 babies born to people on <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/team.html">the Rust teams</a>;</li>
<li>2 years of <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2014/10/30/Stability.html">stability delivered</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>On an average week this year, the Rust community merged 1 RFC and published 83
new crates. Rust topped the &quot;<a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages">most loved</a> language&quot; for the second year in a
row in the StackOverflow survey. Also new this year is <a href="https://thanks.rust-lang.org/">thanks.rust-lang.org</a>,
a site where you can browse contributors by release.</p>
<h2><a href="#rust-in-production" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="rust-in-production"></a>Rust in production</h2>
<p>In addition to the 48 new Rust friends, we now have a <a href="https://rustjobs.rs/">Rust jobs website</a>! More
and more companies are choosing Rust to solve problems involving performance,
scaling, and safety. Let's check in on a few of them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> is using Rust in multiple high-impact projects to manage exabytes of
data on the back end, where correctness and efficiency is critical. Rust code is
also currently shipping in the desktop client on Windows running on <strong>hundreds
of millions</strong> of machines. Jamie Turner recently <a href="https://air.mozilla.org/rust-meetup-may-2017/">spoke at the SF Rust Meetup</a>
about the details on how Rust helps Dropbox use less RAM and get more throughput
with less CPU.</p>
<p>Mozilla, Rust's main sponsor, has accelerated their use of Rust in production.
Not only did <a href="https://blog.servo.org/2016/06/30/servo-nightlies/">Servo start shipping nightly builds</a>, <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/07/shipping-rust-in-firefox/">Firefox 48</a> marked the
first Firefox release that included Rust code as part of the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Oxidation">Oxidation</a>
project. <a href="https://medium.com/mozilla-tech/a-quantum-leap-for-the-web-a3b7174b3c12">Project Quantum</a>, announced in October 2016, is an effort to
incrementally adopt proven parts of Servo into Firefox's rendering engine,
Gecko. <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/05/quantum-up-close-what-is-a-browser-engine/">Check out this blog series</a> that's just getting started for a detailed
look at Project Quantum.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a>, a free and open source desktop environment for Linux, went from
experimenting with Rust in <a href="https://people.gnome.org/~federico/news-2016-10.html#25">librsvg</a> in October 2016 to a <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Hackfests/Rust2017">hackfest</a> in March
to work on the interoperability between GNOME and Rust to enable more GNOME
components to be written in Rust. The hackfest participants made good progress,
be sure to check out the reports at the bottom of the hackfest page for all the
details. We're all excited about the possibilities of Rust and GNOME working
together.</p>
<p>This year, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> started using Rust in production to serve JavaScript packages.
The Rust pieces eliminate performance bottlenecks in their platform that serves
around 350 million packages a day. <a href="http://2017.rustfest.eu/talks/#how-i-convinced-the-world-s-largest-package-manager-to-use-rust-and-so-can-you">Ashley Williams recently gave a
talk</a> at RustFest in Ukraine about npm's experience with Rust in
production; check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCsxYAxw3JQ">video</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="#rust-in-community" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="rust-in-community"></a>Rust in community</h2>
<p>Speaking of conferences, We've had four Rust conferences in the last year:</p>
<ul>
<li>September 9-10, 2016: <a href="http://rustconf.com/2016/">RustConf 2016</a> in Portland, OR, USA;</li>
<li>September 17, 2016: <a href="http://2016.rustfest.eu/">RustFest 2016</a> in Berlin, Germany;</li>

<h2><a href="#rust-in-2017" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="rust-in-2017"></a>Rust in 2017</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/02/06/roadmap.html">2017 Roadmap</a> goals have been great for focusing community efforts towards
the most pressing issues facing Rust today. Of course we'd love for every
aspect of Rust to improve all the time, but we don't have an infinite number of
contributors with an infinite amount of time available yet!</p>
<p>Let's check in on some of the initiatives in each of the goals in the roadmap.
The linked tracking issues give even more detail than the summaries here.</p>
<h3><a href="#rust-should-have-a-lower-learning-curve" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="rust-should-have-a-lower-learning-curve"></a><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/3">Rust should have a lower learning curve</a></h3>
<p>The second edition of <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/book">The Rust Programming Language Book</a> is one chapter shy
of having its initial content complete. There's lots more editing to be done to
get the book ready for publication in October, though. The print version is
currently available for <a href="https://www.nostarch.com/rust">preorder from No Starch</a>, and the online version of
the second edition has boarded <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/book/">the beta train</a> and will be an option in the
documentation shipped with Rust 1.18.0. Steve and I have gotten feedback that
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/second-edition/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html">the ownership chapter</a> especially is much improved and has helped people
understand ownership related concepts better!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/03/02/lang-ergonomics.html">Language Ergonomics Initiative</a> is another part of the lower learning
curve goal that has <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/17">a number of improvements</a> in its pipeline.
The language team is eager to mentor people (another goal!) who are interested
in getting involved with moving these ergonomic improvement ideas forward by
writing RFCs and working with the community to flesh out the details of how
these improvements would work. Comment on the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/17">tracking issue</a> if
you'd like to jump in.</p>

<h3><a href="#rust-should-have-a-pleasant-edit-compile-debug-cycle" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="rust-should-have-a-pleasant-edit-compile-debug-cycle"></a><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/1">Rust should have a pleasant edit-compile-debug cycle</a></h3>
<p>Waiting on the compiler is the biggest roadblock preventing the Rust
development workflow from being described as &quot;pleasant&quot;. So far, a lot of work
has been done behind the scenes to make future improvements possible. Those
improvements are starting to come to fruition, but rest assured that this
initiative is far from being considered complete.</p>
<p>One of the major prerequisites to improvements was adding <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/04/19/MIR.html">MIR</a> (Mid-level
Intermediate Representation) to the compiler pipeline. This year, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/34096">MIR became a
default part of the compilation process</a>.</p>
<p>Because of MIR, we're now able to work on adding incremental recompilation.
Nightly builds currently offer <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/incremental-compilation-beta/4721">&quot;beta&quot; support</a> for it, permitting
the compiler to skip over code generation for code that hasn't changed. We are
in the midst of refactoring the compiler to support finer-grained incremental
computation, allowing us to skip type-checking and other parts of compilation
as well. This refactoring should also offer better support for the IDE work
(see next section), since it enables the compiler to do things like compile a
single function in isolation. We expect to see the next stage of incremental
compilation becoming available over the next few months. If you're interested
in getting involved, please check out the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/4">roadmap issue #4</a>, which
is updated periodically to reflect the current status, as well as places where
help is needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/incremental-compilation-beta/4721">The February post</a> on the &quot;beta&quot; support showed that recompiling in
release mode will often be <strong>five times as fast</strong> with incremental compilation!
This graph shows the improvements in compilation time when making changes to
various parts of the regex crate and rebuilding in release mode:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017-05-Second-Birthday/incremental-compilation.svg" alt="Graph showing improved time with incremental compilation" /></p>
<p>Try out incremental compilation on nightly Rust with
<code>CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1 cargo &lt;command&gt;</code>!</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Niko Matsakis for this incremental compilation summary!</em></p>
<p>We've also made some progress on the time it takes to do a full compilation. On
average, compile times have improved by 5-10% in the last year, but some
worst-case behavior has been fixed that results in &gt;95% improvements in certain
programs. Some very promising improvements are on the way for later this year;
check out <a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/">perf.rust-lang.org</a> for monitoring Rust's performance day-to-day.</p>
<h3><a href="#rust-should-provide-a-basic-but-solid-ide-experience" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="rust-should-provide-a-basic-but-solid-ide-experience"></a><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/2">Rust should provide a basic, but solid IDE experience</a></h3>
<p>As part of our IDE initiative, we created the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rls">Rust Language Server</a> project.
Its goal is to create a single tool that makes it easy for any editor or IDE to
have the full power of the Rust compiler for error checking, code navigation,
and refactoring by using the standard <a href="http://langserver.org/">language server
protocol</a> created by Microsoft and Eclipse.</p>
<p>While still early in its life, today the RLS is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rls#setup">available from rustup</a> for
nightly users. It provides type information on hover, error messages as you
type, and different kinds of code navigation. It even provides refactoring and
formatting as unstable features! It works with projects as large as Cargo.
We're excited to watch the RLS continue to grow and hope to see it make its way
to stable Rust later this year.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Jonathan Turner for this RLS summary!</em></p>
<h3><a href="#rust-should-have-10-level-crates-for-essential-tasks-and-rust-should-provide-easy-access-to-high-quality-crates" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="rust-should-have-10-level-crates-for-essential-tasks-and-rust-should-provide-easy-access-to-high-quality-crates"></a><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/11">Rust should have 1.0-level crates for essential tasks</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/9">Rust should provide easy access to high quality crates</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/05/05/libz-blitz.html">recent post on the Libz Blitz</a> details the Library Team's initiative to
increase the quality of crates for common tasks; that post is excellent so I
won't repeat it here. I will note that many of the issues that the Libs Team
is going to create will be great starter issues. For the blitz to be the best
it can be, the Libs Team is going to need help from the community-- that means
YOU! :) They're willing to mentor people interested in contributing.</p>
<p>In order to make awesome crates easier to find for particular purposes,
crates.io now has <a href="https://crates.io/categories">categories</a> for crate authors to better indicate the use
case of their crate. Crates can also now have CI badges, and
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/41616">more improvements to crates.io's interface</a> are coming that will help you
choose the crates that fit your needs.</p>
<h3><a href="#rust-should-be-well-equipped-for-writing-robust-high-scale-servers" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="rust-should-be-well-equipped-for-writing-robust-high-scale-servers"></a><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/10">Rust should be well-equipped for writing robust, high-scale servers</a></h3>
<p>One of the major events in Rust's ecosystem in the last year was the
introduction of a zero-cost <a href="https://aturon.github.io/blog/2016/08/11/futures/">futures</a> library, and a framework, <a href="https://tokio.rs/">Tokio</a>, for
doing asynchronous I/O on top of it. These libraries are a boon for doing
high-scale, high-reliability server programming, <em>productively</em>. Futures have
been used with great success in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/wangle">C++</a>, <a href="https://finagle.github.io/">Scala</a>, and of course <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">JavaScript</a>
(under the guise of promises), and we're reaping similar benefits in
Rust. However, the Rust library takes a new implementation approach that makes
futures <em>allocation-free</em>. And Tokio builds on that to provide a futures-enabled
event loop, and lots of tools for quickly implementing new protocols. A simple
HTTP server using Tokio is among the fastest measured in the <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r14&hw=ph&test=plaintext">TechEmpower</a>
server benchmarks.</p>
<p>Speaking of protocols, Rust's full-blown HTTP story is solidifying, with
<a href="https://hyper.rs/">Hyper</a>'s master branch currently providing full Tokio support (and official
release imminent). Work on HTTP/2 is well under way. And the web framework
ecosystem is growing too. For example, <a href="https://rocket.rs/">Rocket</a> came out this year: it's a
framework that marries the ergonomics and flexibility of a scripting framework
with the performance and reliability of Rust. Together with supporting
libraries like the <a href="https://diesel.rs/">Diesel</a> ORM, this ecosystem is showing how Rust can provide
slick, ergonomic developer experiences without sacrificing an ounce of
performance or reliability.</p>
<p>Over the rest of this year, we expect all of the above libraries to
significantly mature; for a middleware ecosystem to sprout up; for the
selection of supported protocols and services to grow; and, quite possibly, to
tie all this all together with an <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> notation that works natively
with Rust's futures.</p>

<h3><a href="#rust-should-integrate-easily-into-large-build-systems" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="rust-should-integrate-easily-into-large-build-systems"></a><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/12">Rust should integrate easily into large build systems</a></h3>
<p>Cargo, Rust's native package manager and build system, is often cited as one of
people's favorite aspects of Rust. But of course, the world runs on many build
systems, and when you want to bring a chunk of the Rust ecosystem into a large
organization that has its own existing build system, smooth integration is
paramount.</p>
<p>This initiative is mostly in the ideas stage; we've done a lot of work with
stakeholders to understand the challenges in build system integration today,
and we think we have a good overall vision for how to solve them. There's lots
of great discussion on the tracking issue that has resulted in a few Cargo
issues like these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/3815">Support creating a build plan</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/3816">Support declaring external dependencies</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are a lot of details yet to be worked out; keep an eye out for more
improvement in this area soon.</p>
<h3><a href="#rusts-community-should-provide-mentoring-at-all-levels" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="rusts-community-should-provide-mentoring-at-all-levels"></a><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/13">Rust's community should provide mentoring at all levels</a></h3>
<p>The &quot;all levels&quot; part of the roadmap item is important to us: it's about
onboarding first-time contributors as well as adding folks all the way up at
the core team level (like me, hi!)</p>
<p>For people just getting started with Rust, we held <a href="https://github.com/rust-community/rustbridge">RustBridge</a> events before
RustFest Berlin and Rust Belt Rust. There's another coming up, planned for the
day before RustConf in Portland!</p>
<p>The Mozilla Rust folks are going to have <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Outreachy">Outreachy</a> and <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4730059156881408">GSoC</a> interns this
summer working on a variety of projects.</p>
<p>We've also had success involving contributors when there are low-committment,
high impact tasks to be done. One of those efforts was <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/08/10/Shape-of-errors-to-come.html">improving the format of
error messages</a>-- check out the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/35233">82 participants on this issue</a>! The Libz Blitz
mentioned in a previous section is set up specifically to be another source of
mentoring opportunities.</p>
<p>In January, the Language Team introduced <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/language-team-shepherds/4595">shepherds</a>, which is partly about
mentoring a set of folks around the Language Team. The shepherds have been
quite helpful in keeping RFC discussions moving forward!</p>
<p>We've also been working to grow both the number and size of subteams, to create
more opportunities for people to step into leadership roles.</p>
<p>There's also less formal ways that we've been helping people get involved with
various initiatives. I've worked with many people at many places in their Rust
journey: helping out with the conferences, giving their first conference talks,
providing feedback on the book, working on crates, contributing to Rust itself,
and joining teams! While it's hard to quantify scenarios like these, everywhere
I turn, I see Rustaceans helping other Rustaceans and I'm grateful this is part
of our culture.</p>
<h2><a href="#rust-in-the-future" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="rust-in-the-future"></a>Rust in the future</h2>
<p>At two years old, Rust is finding its way into all corners of programming, from
web development, to embedded systems, and even your desktop. The libraries and
the infrastructure are maturing, we're paving the on-ramp, and we're supporting
each other. I'm optimistic about the direction Rust is taking!</p>
<p>Happy birthday, Rust! Here's to many more! üéâ</p>
